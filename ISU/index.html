        Black holes are bodies that have such intense gravitational fields that
        both matter and light cannot escape it. The higher the density of the
        black hole, the stronger the gravitational field on its surface will be.
        For a celestial object to become a black hole, a density would have to
        be reached such that the subatomic particles of the object cannot
        support their own weight, and they collapse

            Essentially, general relativity explains that space is curved, which is why gravity exists. It furthermore states that time and space are not separate, 
            but they together form spacetime, which is a geometry formed from space and time together. Therefore the straight paths in this curved spacetime are geodesics, and the shortest path between two points is taken by a beam of light
            A geodesic will be more curved if the gravitational field is stronger in that region. So the geodesics in a black hole are so intensely curved that photons, which are packets of light, are not able to escape

          <h1>Event Horizon</h1>
          <div><img src="images/eventhorizon.jpg" alt="spacetime" /></div>
          <p>Since there are no geodesics which allow for straight lines in a black hole’s radius, a point in a black hole which is connected with a point anywhere else will essentially have no dimension. Black holes have an event horizon, which is their spherical surface that blocks off the events taking place inside the black hole to anything happening outside of it.
            Therefore, the event horizon is the boundary on a black hole where information cannot be observed by anyone, therefore has no effect on that observer. It can also be described as the area around the gravitational field of a black hole.
            The only things that can be observed of a black hole from spacetime is its mass, rate of spin, and net charge

          Laplace was a French physicist who made significant advancements on the theory behind black holes before black holes was even a term. In his publishment called Exposition du Systeme du Monde, Laplace use Michell’s theory to make more advancements to it. Using Newton’s corpuscular theory, which states that light emits ‘minute particles’ which are called corpuscles, that there should be stars which do not let any light emit out from it. Laplace did include calculations of escape velocity, but light not being able to escape a gravitational field was not numerically reasonable to showcase during this era.

            the star, and it created a ring of debris around the black hole.
            This ring of debris is in the orbital plane of the other star, which

              As of right now, the vast majority of space missions dedicated to black hole observations are conducted by NASA. However, the missions which NASA carries out may take a large dip. In 2024, Congress began to cut money from NASA’s budget
            </li>
            <li>
              In NASA’s final budget for 2024, they had more than $2 billion worth in space initiatives and research projects cut off from the government, which included Black Hole space initiatives
            </li>
            <li>
              This is not the first time where financial obstacles have hindered black hole research. In 2012, the Gravity and Extreme Magnetism Small Explorer mission, which was planned to observe X-ray emissions from black holes, was abruptly cancelled due to the budget going roughly $50 million over their capacity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Furthermore, in this past year, the Chandra X-ray observatory, which has made groundbreaking contributions to black hole research as shown above, has had its funding cut by nearly 40%, and there are plans to have more funding cuts for the observatory.

              The laws of the universe seem to bend, quite literally, when it comes to black holes. A scientific obstacle that arises when studying black holes is when studying them in relation to Einsteinian cubic gravity, which is an extension of general relativity. Even though black holes have unique and cool properties, when Einstein’s equation is applied to them, it cannot be solved numerically. This showcases the difficulty behind mathematically modelling black holes
            </li>
            <li>
              Black holes do not emit any light, therefore the methods used to detect black holes relies on observing the matter around it instead
            </li>
            <li>
              The singularity of a black hole, which is basically the center of it, breaks the laws of quantum theory and general relativity.
            </li>
            <li>
              The data as of right now collected by telescopes such as the EHT has to be physically transferred from locations like the South Pole which can take nearly a year to accomplish
